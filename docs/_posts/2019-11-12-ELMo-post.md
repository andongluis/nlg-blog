title: Learning ELMo Easy as Tickling Some Monster
---

This should be the begininign of the ELMo post, now I'm not super sure how this works, so lets try a bunch of stuff


# THis is a title, should be quite big

## This is a smaller title

### Even smaller


Lets try to make some list now:
- one thing
- two thing
- three thing

Now my link to google is this link [lol link here](https://allennlp.org/elmo)

<a href="http://example.com/" target="_blank">example with link in new tab, cant be done in markdown itself</a>

Thi word might be in **bold** and this one might be in *italic*.

More list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

Another list

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
