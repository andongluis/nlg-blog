title: Learning ELMo: Easy as Tickling Some Monster
---

This should be the begininign of the ELMo post, now I'm not super sure how this works, so lets try a bunch of stuff


# THis is a title, should be quite big

## This is a smaller title

### Even smaller


Lets try to make some list now:
- one thing
- two thing
- three thing



Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).
The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
